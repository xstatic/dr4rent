Author Contact
http://drupal.org/project/authorcontact
================


DESCRIPTION
------------
Creates a block that shows a contact form that when submitted, sends a simple
contact email to the author of the current node. This might be useful for a
multi-user blog or auction site, for example.


DEPENDENCIES
------------
Core Contact module.


INSTALLING
----------
1. Copy the 'authorcontact' folder to your sites/all/modules directory.
2. Go to Administer > Site building > Modules. Enable the module.


CONFIGURING AND USING
---------------------
1. Go to Administer > Administer > Site building > Blocks. Drag-and-drop the
block 'Author Contact' to a visible region.

2. Click on SAVE BLOCKS button.

3. Click on CONFIGURE link beside the block 'Author Contact'.

Although the block will automatically only show on nodes, you should configure
it to only show on the nodes you want - eg only on blog content types or certain
URLs.

From the block configuration page you can also set text to appear at the top of
the form. This could give a short instruction or reminder to include your phone
number, etc.

4. It is also suggested you install the Captcha module to help prevent spam
going to your node authors - see http://drupal.org/node/311349 for some help
with this.

5. Please note that this module now takes notice of each user's setting for
'personal contact form' in their profile. If a user has not allowed personal
contact, the Author Contact form will not appear on their nodes.
